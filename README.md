# Web-Design-Challenge

The purpose of this website is to showcase newly-acquired skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The approach utilized images and data that were generated from a previous homework exercise for Web APIs, which were used to construct a simple Bootstrap-powered website to display the data and provide easy, intuitive navigation.

The website consists of seven distinct pages listed below, each of which will be described in greater detail.

* index.html
* comparisons.html
* data.html
* temperature.html
* humidity.html
* cloudiness.html
* windspd.html
