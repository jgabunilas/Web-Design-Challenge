The website consists of seven distinct pages listed below, each of which will be described in greater detail.

* index.html
* comparisons.html
* data.html
* temperature.html
* humidity.html
* cloudiness.html
* windspd.html

## Descriptions of Pages

## All Pages - Navigation Bar

All pages include a dynamic and responsive navigation bar containing links to the landing page, the comparisons page, the data page, and the individual analysis pages (contained within a dropdown menu). The formatting of the navigation bar changes slightly based on the size of the window.

## index.html

The landing page contains a short explanation of the project, a sample image from one of the visualizations, and a sidebar with clickable images for each visualization that take the user to the respective page for that analysis. The main page content lives within a bootstrap column of size 8, while the sidebar is a separate column of size 4. The sidebar image layout is responsive to the size of the window.

## comparisons.html

The comparisons page displays the four visualizations that were generated by the Weather API analysis. The images themselves are hyperlinks that will take the user to the respective analysis page. The layout of the images is responsive and depends on the size of the window.

## data.html

The data table contains the data that was used to generate the visualizations and analyses. It is a Bootstrap table object with formatted striping. It is also responsive, fitting within the its container when the window is reduced in size.

 ## temperature.html, humidity.html, cloudiness.html, and windspd.html

 The individual data analysis pages contain the visualization for each respective analysis and a short explanation of the data. Similar to the landing page, each visualizaiton page also includes a responsive sidebar with the visualizations that link to the respective pages. Within the sidebar, the image corresponding to the current visualization page is highlighed by a colored box.
